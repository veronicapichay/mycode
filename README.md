Linux/Python Crash Course


Lecture and Labs 10 Day Course
Course Overview

This course combines three days of Linux Essentials content with two weeks of Python for Developers.

Linux is at the core of nearly all open-source projects. If you want to become a developer, then Linux is the engine that will run nearly all of your code. Your view of Linux will be different from a Linux System admin who must make sure that system availability is as close to 100% as possible. As a developer, you will be required to make Linux bend to your will, which means you will have great power over the system. With great power comes great responsibility. You must be able to use Linux to accomplish your task, while not adversely affecting system reliability, security or operational efficiency. In this course you will learn how to make Linux deliver essential services and in the same motion, maintain the Linux system integrity. Successful students can generally expect their work efficiency to increase dramatically.

Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level language that gets work done in a hurry! Python can improve all professionalâ€™s ability to do work and is freely available on all major platforms without a charge.

Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) have become increasingly important as they provide developers with connectivity to everything from rich datasets in an array of formats (such as JSON), to exposing the configurability of software applications and network appliances. The focus of this course is to build strong Python coding skills by teaching the foundations of Python, moving into interacting, designing, and building APIs for the purposes of scripting automated solutions to complex tasks.
